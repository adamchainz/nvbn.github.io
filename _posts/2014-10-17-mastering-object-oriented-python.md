![book cover](/assets/0971OS.jpg) Few days ago I finished reading
["Mastering Object-oriented Python" by Steven F. Lott](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-object-oriented-python),
and I think it's nearly a good book. Maybe it's longer than need (~600 pages) and
sometimes I used to think that content repeats. Some code samples are controversial and
not always follows PEP8.

But I think this book worth reading, they contains good explanation of magic methods,
good examples of using `abc` and `collections.abc`, interesting chapter about logging
and good manual for documenting python code.

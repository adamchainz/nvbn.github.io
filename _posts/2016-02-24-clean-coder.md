![book cover](/assets/clean_coder_book.jpg) Friends recommended me
to read [The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers by Robert C. Martin](http://www.amazon.com/The-Clean-Coder-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073).
And recently I read it. The book explains some parts of engineer's work, makes some useful points. And proves
them with real life stories. Most of things in the book are well known, but it's nice
that author describes not only "good path", but also situations when something gone wrong.

By the way, the book is interesting to read.

![book cover](/assets/ux_book.jpg) I've always wanted to learn more
about UX and found [Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug](https://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html).
It's a short book, and it's interesting and easy to read. It explains
usability concepts by examples of web and mobile apps. The book
even contains accessibility advices.

I don't know much about UX, but in my opinion this book is nice.

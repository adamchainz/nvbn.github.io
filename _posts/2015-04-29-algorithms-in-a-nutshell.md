![book cover white](/assets/algorithms_book.jpg) Sometimes I have a
strange feeling that I forgot almost all algorithms, in the previous
time when that occurred I watched [a course about it](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI)
and now I read [Algorithms in a Nutshell by George T. Heineman, Gary Pollice, Stanley Selkow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596516246.do).
So it's a bit boring book (like all other books about algorithms), but
worth reading. It contains explanation of well known and even less famous
algorithms with code examples (they said examples will be in Ruby, but almost 
all of them in C++ and Java), places when a reader can use them and
benchmarks.

The downside of this book &ndash; it contains less than nothing about
data structures.

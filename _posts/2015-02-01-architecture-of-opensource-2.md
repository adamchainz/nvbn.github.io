![book cover](/assets/architecture_of_opensource.jpg) I read the first volume
of this book about a year ago and I liked it, and now I've finished
[the second volume](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html) and wasn't disappointed.
Not all chapters of the book was interesting for me, but most of them &mdash; was.
It was very interesting to read about architecture of Git, GHC, DLR, nginx,
Processing.js, PyPy, SQLAlchemy, Yesod and ZeroMQ.

And in this book not only architecture explained, almost all chapters contains
cool "Lessons Learned" section, where explained about right and wrong decisions
made in projects. Also a lot of chapters contains history of projects, it's interesting
to read how and why projects evolved to the current state.

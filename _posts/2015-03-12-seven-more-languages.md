![book cover white](/assets/7more_lang_book.jpg) I read the previous book
of this series ([Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks))
about a year ago so now I finished reading
[Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks: Languages That Are Shaping the Future by Bruce Tate, Fred Daoud, Jack Moffitt, Ian Dees](https://pragprog.com/book/7lang/seven-more-languages-in-seven-weeks)
and I wasn't disappointed. This books contains good description and
explanation of core concepts of seven languages: Lua, Factor, Elixir,
Elm, Julia, MiniKanren and Idris. Actually MiniKanren isn't a
general-purpose language, it's a DSL, in this book used [core.logic](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic)
for Clojure.

For me most interesting was reading (and doing exercises) about
Elm, MiniKanren, Factor and Idris. And I think I'll try to use some
ideas and patterns from this languages in my projects. Also in this
book I've seen a cool concept of tables and meta tables in Lua, and I'll
probably try to write something in this language, maybe some little
game with [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/).

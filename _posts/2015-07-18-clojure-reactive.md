![book cover](/assets/clojure_reactive_book.jpg) Recently I've got a few free books from PACKT
and as one to read I chose [Clojure Reactive Programming by Leonardo Borges](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/clojure-reactive-programming).
I'm already familiar with most of concepts and libs described in this book, but
I guess it's a good book. The book explains Rx extensions and usage of them from Clojure
and ClojureScript, explains core.async and React (and Om), so I think it touches all aspects
of "reactive" (such a buzzword). And coolest part of this book is appendix, it about
library design but with functors and monads.

So summing up everything, this book is a bit for newbies, but great.

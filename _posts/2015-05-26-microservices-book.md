![book cover](/assets/microservices_book.jpg) Few days ago I finished reading
[Building Microservices by Sam Newman](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033158.do)
and I can say is the one of the greatest book I read in the last year. It describes
rationale of microservices, technical problems and possible solutions, view to the theme
from management side and a lot more. The book describes development of modern distributed
system from all aspects, but not goes deep in details.
 
Definitely worth reading!

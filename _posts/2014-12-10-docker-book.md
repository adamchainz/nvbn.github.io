![book cover](/assets/docker_book.png) Few days ago I finished reading
[The Docker Book by James Turnbull](http://www.dockerbook.com/) and probably it's
a good book for them who start using the Docker. This book contains explanation of
patterns of usage of the Docker: using for development, for testing and for
deploy. About how the Docker works inside. And a lot of information about tools
which simplify work with the Docker, I learned about the good tool
called [Fig](http://www.fig.sh/) from this book.

Maybe some parts of this book duplicates official documentation,
but for me this book been a great addition to it. And maybe it's because I
didn't used the Docker a lot before.

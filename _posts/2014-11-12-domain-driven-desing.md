![book cover](/assets/ddd_book.jpg) This week I finished reading
["Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software" by Eric Evans](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software-ebook/dp/B00794TAUG/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=)
and I think it's a great book, maybe &mdash; "must read". It contains a good explanation
of patterns with example situations where they should be used. Also this book
contains interesting information about software design and software development on the whole.

From the opposite side, this is quite an old book, it was published in 2003. And some
parts of the book are a bit outdated, some patterns and examples are useless
now. Also some examples are too "enterprise", and classes like
`CargoSpecificationRepositoryFactory` scare me. And after reading some
examples, I assume that it was painful to be a java developer in early 00.

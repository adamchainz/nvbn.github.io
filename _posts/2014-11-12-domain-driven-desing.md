![book cover](/assets/ddd_book.jpg) On this week I finished reading
["Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software" by Eric Evans](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software-ebook/dp/B00794TAUG/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=)
and I think it's a great book, maybe "must read". It contains good explanation
of patterns with example situations where they should be used. Also this book
contains interesting information about software design and software development in whole.

From the opposite side, this is a quite old book, it published in 2003. And some
parts of book are a bit outdated, some patterns and examples are useless
now. Also some examples are too "enterprise", and classes like
`CargoSpecificationRepositoryFactory` scares me. And after reading some
examples, I assume that it been painful to be java developer in early 00.

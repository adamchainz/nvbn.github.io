![book cover](/assets/lisp_book.jpg) On Reddit I stumbled on 
[Build Your Own Lisp by Daniel Holden](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/) and
decided to read it. And it's one of the most interesting technical book I'm read.
Reading this book I refreshed my knowledge of C, got few ideas for
my own projects and even almost built my own Lisp.

Although in this book explains building process of not actual Lisp,
it doesn't have quotation `'(f x)`, it uses Q-Expressions `{f x}`.
And also it doesn't have macros. But the book suggested readers
to write all of that in the last chapter.

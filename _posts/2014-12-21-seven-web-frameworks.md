![book cover white](/assets/7web_book.jpg) I'm a big fan of seven in seven books series
of The Pragmatic Bookshelf, so I decided to read
["Seven Web Frameworks in Seven Weeks: Adventures in Better Web Apps" by Jack Moffitt and Fred Daoud](https://pragprog.com/book/7web/seven-web-frameworks-in-seven-weeks).
And few days ago I finished, and for me this book been a very pleasant reading. It been very interesting to try
untouched frameworks and examples from this book helped me a lot.

I worked before with [Clojure Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring)
and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) which were good examined in this book, so I can assume that
other frameworks too. And after reading this book I think I definitely should try to write
something using [webmachine](https://github.com/basho/webmachine) and [Yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com/).

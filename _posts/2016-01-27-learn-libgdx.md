![book cover](/assets/libgdx_book.jpg) I'm a bit interested in game development and [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)
seems to be a good framework,
so I read [Learning LibGDX Game Development by Andreas Oehlke](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/learning-libgdx-game-development-second-edition).
I've planned to read about best practices, edge cases and how it works inside. And
it's not that kind of book. It's just an entry level tutorial with a lot of printed code.

But the author described development of a little game touching almost all LibGDX parts. So maybe it's a
nice tutorial for newcomers.

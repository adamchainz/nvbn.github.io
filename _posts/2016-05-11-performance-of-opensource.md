![book cover](/assets/posa-cover.png) I already read all other 
books from this series (The Architecture of Open Source Applications volumes I and II)
so I decided to read latest book &ndash; [The Performance of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html).
And it's quite a nice book. Not all chapters were interesting for me. But
it was lovely to read about network stack of Chrome and about performance
problems in it and about Mozilla's stack problems and solutions.

Also the book contains great explanation why pings on mobile devices can be big,
and what problems can it cause.

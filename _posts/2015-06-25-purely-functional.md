![book cover](/assets/purely_functional_book.jpg) I was interested how common
data structures were implemented in FP languages and decided to read 
[Purely Functional Data Structures by Chris Okasaki](http://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/dp/0521663504).
I can't say that I understood all parts of this book, especially the last chapters.
But reading and solving exercises from the book gave me
some thoughts. And I guess I got more than enough answers to almost all
my questions about functional data structures.
 
Also a good thing in this book &mdash; all examples are in SML and Haskell.
And reading examples in SML is a more pleasure than reading them in C or Java,
at least for me.

![book cover white](/assets/react_native_book.jpg) Recently I'm started
to use Ansible. Before that I mostly worked with Puppet, so I decided
to read something about Ansible and read [Ansible: Up and Running by Lorin Hochstein](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035626.do).

And it's a nice book, explains most aspects of Ansible. Shows real world
use cases and a lot of playbooks.

Definitely it's a nice book for whom who start working with Ansible.

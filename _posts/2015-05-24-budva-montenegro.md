The latest three month I was living In Budva, Montenegro. It's a small
town between the sea and the mountains with great climate (in comparison with weather
in Saint-Petersburg, Russia).

I was working remotely and lived by a tourist visa (maybe not a visa,
just a stamp in a passport), because of that I was required to leave the country once a month
(probably origin country depend). It's a bit troublesome, but I visited Istanbul (Turkey)
and Belgrade (Serbia), which is nice.

Also in Montenegro It's obligatory to receive the document called "beli karton". For that
you need to pay around €25 (for a month) in a bank, and receive this document in tourists office.
 
As a landline internet only ADSL available with 7Mbps/768kbps (works more like 3-4Mbps), which
is enough for most of tasks, but pulling docker images and pushing code to GAE was a pain.
Costs around €25. 

For a mobile internet I used packs for 1GB for €3 for 15 days, I don't remember the speed,
but according to the indicator on the phone it was HSDPA. 

About prices:

* one-bedroom apartments for a month if you rent for three &ndash; €200;
* utilities (including internet and mobile phone) &ndash; €50-70;
* food for one person for a week, meat/fish/seafood everyday &ndash; €30-50;
* can of beer &ndash; €1-1.25;
* bottle of local wine &ndash; €4;
* burger/kebab &ndash; €0.8-1.2.

Also I tried to work from a beach, and with my laptop screen it wasn't possible.

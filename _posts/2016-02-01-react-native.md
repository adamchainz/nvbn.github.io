![book cover white](/assets/react_native_book.jpg) Lately I'm working a lot with
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and mobile development looks interesting to me. So I decided
to read something about [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and chosen
[Learning React Native by Bonnie Eisenman](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920041511.do?sortby=publicationDate).
It's a short book, mostly in tutorial format. Explains differences with React and
platform specific things.

But the book have a few downsides, there's too much screenshots of XCode and app stores, book mostly written for OS X
users and contains not so much info for Android development.

Sums up everything, it seems to be a nice introductory book.
